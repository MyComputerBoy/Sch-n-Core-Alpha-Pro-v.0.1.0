 Schön Core Alpha Pro v.0.1.0 Python Edition
 
 My 32 bit single core CPU

 This is the refactoring branch where I'm remaking the whole project with less room for bugs and more readable code.
 I'm also trying to keep everything as documented and maintainable as possible.

 The majority of the emulator should be done but needs thorough testing while the assembler needs considerable amount of reimplementation.
