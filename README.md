# Schön Core Alpha Pro v.0.1.0
 Schön Core Alpha Pro v.0.1.0 Python Edition

------------------------------
 It is still work in progress!
------------------------------
 
 My 32 bit single core CPU with built in support for different types of variables 
 (such as float, array and chars, full list will be in documentation when it is created).

 I'm refactoring the whole project for making everything more managable, readable and upgradable
 (In the refactoring branch)
 I heavily depend on python enums for making sure everything is easily readable and debug friendly
(Please don't look too much at the main branch as it is old and basically legacy code xD)
